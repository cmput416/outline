Ever wondered why the Ariane 5 rocket blew up (https://youtu.be/5tJPXYA0Nec), and how we could have possibly avoided that catastrophy? Or how we could have prevented hackers from remotely taking control of a Jeep Cheerokee (https://youtu.be/MK0SrxBC1xs)? Or perhaps you're interested to know how the Heartbleed security vulnerability (https://youtu.be/WgrBrPW_Zn4) made the whole world panick for a while before it was fixed?

If you are, then "CMPUT 497 -- Foundations of Program Analysis" is for you! ]

In this course you will learn the basic concepts that enable you to ask analyze the runtime behaviour of programs without necessarily executing them. The course will cover the basic theory with hands-on assignments, as well as a wide range of applications for program analysis such as bug finding tools, security vulnerability detection, probablistic programming, and more!
